                            <p>That means being ready for failure and learning from mistakes, nothing beats finding an issue and optimizing the solutions.</p>

                            <p>It's important to apply yourself to the situation, no problem has strictly one answer and there’s always room to improve. Put your own stamp on things, give it a twist, think beyond your walls.</p>

                            <p>I’m always striving for self improvement, and looking for advice from outside my reach.</p>
